The LFW face data as a mat-file is on Weibull (UMass Vision Group server): 

/scratch1/arunirc/FV_CNN_Face/data/all_img_lfw_funneled.mat

 The MAT-file contains all 13233 LFW images in a cell array, and their corresponding filenames.

Download and copy to the ./data folder


The ./data/lists folder had text files with the image names of LFW pairs I find easier to use.
Taken from the publicly available LFW-a dataset. http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/data/lfwa/
